The following task is part of a research investigation into how people learn about visual sequences. It has two parts. Part One involves seeing two long sequences of different kinds of visual patterns one by one. Your main job is just to watch them, but to make it a little more interesting you'll be asked to press a button whenever you see a repeated pattern. After viewing the sequence for about 10 minutes, we'll ask you some questions about the kinds of patterns you learned. Then you'll spend 10 minutes on the next sequence.<br><br>

After doing that, we'll change gears a little bit in Part Two. This time you'll be given some visual memory tests with very similar-looking items as in Part One (but not the exact same items). As before, there will be two separate tests with two different sets of items. For each test you'll see a series of questions in which you see one item fairly quickly, and then it will go away and you'll have to select which of four possible items it was. These should take about 5-10 minutes per test.<br><br>

As you can see, this is a fairly long study: we estimate it will take you 30-45 minutes and definitely no less than 25. Moreover you will need to be paying attention the whole time. Thus, please don't agree to do it if you aren't in a reasonably quiet environment without interruptions for that period of time. That said, it's kind of fun (at least some people say it is...). Plus, we'll explain what it was all about at the end!<br><br>
