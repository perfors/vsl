All right! You should have noticed that amongst those items there was the word <em>dog</em>. Had this been the real task, you would right now be shown a text box in which you would be expected to write <em>dog</em>.<br><br>

You'll have to do the same thing for the real sequence: notice any English words that go by and write them down so you remember them. The visual stimuli are much more interesting than in this sample sequence but it does last a while -- about ten minutes. Do your best to pay attention but don't make any special effort to learn anything; we're trying to understand what kinds of things people will pick up in a normal situation. After that we'll ask you some questions about the kinds of patterns you saw. There are no right or wrong answers, so just do your best.<br><br>

When you're ready to get started, press "Next". We'll begin by asking a few questions to make sure you understood these instructions, and then once you get those right, it's on to the sequence!<br><br>
