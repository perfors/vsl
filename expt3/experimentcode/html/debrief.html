<em>What was that about, anyway?</em><br><br>

As we mentioned at the beginning of this experiment, we are interested in understanding how people visually process things. We know that statistical learning, the ability to detect regularities in the environment for prediction of events, is involved in a range of learning domains (e.g. language acquisition). However, much less is known about how exactly SL operates to affect learning and cognitive abilities, as well as why some people are better at SL than others, and why there is no association between SL performance in one domain (e.g. auditory) and another (e.g. visual). This study is an attempt at clarifying these puzzles and to test whether familiarity influences visual SL through more efficient encoding of stimuli.<br><br>

Each of you were tested on statistical learning (pattern recognition, i.e. “which sequence is more familiar?”, and pattern completion, i.e. “what comes next?”) based on the stimuli you saw flashing on the screen. One task, containing Chinese characters, was designed so that these items would be familiar to only Chinese speakers and not non-Chinese speakers. The other, containing novel shapes, was designed so that both Chinese and non-Chinese speakers would not find them familiar at all. This study design allows us to compare familiarity conditions with SL performance to see if familiarity indeed improves SL.<br><br> 

The tasks on perceptual fluency, where you had to indicate which item you think was flashed first in a series of two items flashed in quick succession, enables us to examine the relation between familiarity and perceptual fluency. Our hypothesis is that familiar items improve visual SL performance, and we cite efficiency in encoding (i.e. perceptual fluency) as the link through which this occurs. We test this by comparing SL performance and perceptual fluency between the group of you who are Chinese speakers against the group of you who are not.<br><br>

Again, we are very grateful to the data you provide, as it allows us to examine deeper how human beings process things and learn.<br><br>
