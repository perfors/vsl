In this experiment we are interested in how people learn about visual sequences. You will therefore see two long sequences of different kinds of visual patterns one by one. Each sequence plays automatically and takes about 10 minutes total. Your main job is just to watch it: don't try to write anything down, just watch. Because watching is pretty boring, though, and because we want to make sure you're paying attention, you have an additional task as well. Here is how it goes:<br><br>

Every so often instead of a pattern, you'll see an entire English word. When you do, just write it down. For instance, if you saw the sequence A - B - F - pizza - F - D, you should write down <em>pizza</em>. At the end of the sequence you'll be given a text box in which you should input all of the words you saw (in this case, <em>pizza</em>). Over the course of the entire sequence there will be between 2 and 10 English words (not the same ones in each sequence). Try to get them all! And when you're not writing anything down, just watch and do your best to pay attention to the items that flash on the screen. After viewing the sequence for about 10 minutes, we'll ask you some questions about the kinds of patterns you learned.<br><br> 

You can then take a little break (as long as you want) before watching another sequence. It has different patterns but the task is otherwise identical. As with the first time, you'll need to write down the English words you see in the middle and will be asked some questions at the end.<br><br>

Once you've seen both 10-minute sequences, you'll be asked to do two shorter (and hopefully more fun) tasks. In each one you'll see one item flash on screen fairly quickly, and then it will go away and you'll have to select which of four possible items it was. If you get the question right, the next item will be faster. Each task involves multiple items but is reasonably fast (depending on how fast you are!), taking about 3-5 minutes each.<br><br>

This experiment will require some concentration and you will need to be paying attention the whole time. You can take breaks in between the tasks but need to stay focused during them. We'll explain what it was all about at the end!
