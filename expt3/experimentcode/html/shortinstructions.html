The following task is part of a research investigation into how people learn about visual sequences. It involves seeing two long sequences of different kinds of visual patterns one by one. Your main job is just to watch them, but to make it a little more interesting you'll be asked to press a button whenever you see a repeated pattern. After viewing the sequence for about 10 minutes, we'll ask you some questions about the kinds of patterns you learned. Then you'll spend 10 minutes on the next sequence.<br><br>

Overall, we estimate it will take you 20-30 minutes to do. Moreover you will need to be paying attention the whole time. Thus, please don't agree to do it if you aren't in a reasonably quiet environment without interruptions for that period of time. That said, it's kind of fun (at least some people say it is...). Plus, we'll explain what it was all about at the end!<br><br>
