You are done with the first (and main) part of the experiment -- learning the two different sequences. Now is your chance to take another well-deserved break: stretch, yawn, go get a drink, whatever you like. When you are ready, you can start the last part: taking two (shorter) tests measuring your memory for visual items kind of like the ones you saw in the sequences.<br><br>

The way each of these tests work is you'll see two items flash up on the screen very quickly one after another. Your job is to remember the FIRST item; the second is there to distract you, so try to ignore it. Then both items will disappear and you'll have to select which of four items is the one you saw FIRST. The test is an adaptive test, which means that when you get an answer correct, the first item will flash faster and faster (the second item doesn't change). If you get it wrong, the first item will flash slower (i.e., stay on the screen for longer) and it will get easier. What this means is that the test should stay at a reasonably high level of difficulty even if you do well -- but that if you do well it will go faster. So don't worry if it seems hard: it's designed to! Just do your best, and the better you do the faster you'll be done with this experiment.<br><br>

When you're ready to get started, press "Next". We'll begin by asking a few questions to make sure you understood these instructions, and then once you get those right, it's on to the two tests!<br><br>
