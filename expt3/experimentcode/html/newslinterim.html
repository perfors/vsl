Congratulations! You are done with the first part of the experiment -- learning a sequence. Now is your chance to take a well-deserved break: stretch, yawn, go get a drink, whatever you like. When you are ready, you can start the next part: learning another sequence with different items. Other than having different items, the task is the same as last time. Just watch as they go by, try to figure out which ones follow which others but don't write anything down except the English words you see interspersed throughout.<br><br>

When you're ready to get started, press "Next".<br><br>
