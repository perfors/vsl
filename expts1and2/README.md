\f0\b\fs28 \cf0 README: file names and variable names\

\b0\fs24 \
Everything is in the fulldataset.RData data file. It contains several smaller datasets, as follows:\
\

\b ** Dataset d **
\b0 \
\
This is the primary dataset with the 132 participants in Experiment 1, with data from both sessions.\
\
workerID: unique identifier for each participant\
Education: education level for each participant\
Gender: gender\
Age: age in years\
Country: where they live\
SL1condition: condition in session 1, could be either Unfamiliar or Familiar\
SL2 condition: condition on SL task in session 2, could be either Unfamiliar or Familiar\
Condition: Same if the SL condition was the same in both sessions, different otherwise\
SL1correct: this is SLscore on the SL task in session 1, could be between 0 and 1 \
Sl1traincorr: how many of the words embedded in the stream they got correct (check question) in session 1\
PF1type: matches SL1 condition, it is the first PF task, can be Unfamiliar or Familiar\
PF2type: matches SL2 condition, it is the second PF task, can be Unfamiliar or Familiar\

\cf0 SL2 correct: this is SLscore on the SL task in session 2, could be between 0 and 1 \
Sl2traincorr: how many of the words embedded in the stream they got correct (check question) in session 2\
PF1pauseavg: avg latency on first set of PF trials (PFscore)\
PF2pauseavg: avg latency on second set of PF trials (PFscore)\
PF1correct: # of first set of PF trials correct, this is less meaningful because it equilibrates by changing the latency\
PF2correct: # of second set of PF trials correct, this is less meaningful because it equilibrates by changing the latency\

\

\b ** Dataset d1all **
\b0 \
\
Contains all session 1 data including the participants in Experiment 2. All variable names are the same as in dataset d.\
\

\b ** Dataset dl **
\b0 \
\
Long form of the data in dataset d \'97 each row is a session rather than each row is a participant. Necessary for some analyses. All variable names should be straightforward extensions of d (e.g., SLcorrect contains either SL1correct or SL2correct, with the additional variable session indicating which is which)\
\

\b ** Dataset PFmeans **
\b0 \
\
Dataset for all 48 PF trials. On each one, it has the average mean across all participants. \
PF1: all first PF trials\
PF2: all second PF trials\
Familiar: all Familiar PF trials\
Unfamiliar: all Unfamiliar PF trials\
\

\b ** Dataset PFsds **
\b0 \
\
Same as PFmeans, but standard deviations instead.\
\

\b ** Dataset SL1 **
\b0 \
\
Used for calculating the item-by-item correlation between each of the SL tasks in session 1 and the items in Siegelman et al (2017). Each row is an item (item #s correspond to the item numbers in Siegelman et al (2017). \
\
Base: accuracy (SLscore) reported in Siegelman et al (2017) for that item\
All: accuracy over all Session 1 conditions for that item in our task\
Familiar: accuracy on Familiar trials for that item in our task\

\cf0 Unfamiliar: accuracy on Unfamiliar trials for that item in our task\
UnfSimple: accuracy on UnfSimple trials for that item in our task\

\b ** Dataset SL2 **
\b0 \
\
Same thing as SL1 except for session 2 (so there is no UnfSimple)\
