Right now you will learn two consecutive sequences of visual objects. Each one will play automatically and take about 10 minutes total. Your main job is just to watch it: don't try to write anything down, just watch. Because watching is pretty boring, though, and because we want to make sure you're paying attention, you have one additional task as well. It is as follows.<br><br>

Every so often you'll see an item that repeats two in a row. When you do, your task will be to click on that item. For instance, if you saw the sequence A - B - F - F - B - D then you should click the second F. You'll see a running tally of your "score" at the top of the screen. If you click correctly (i.e., when there is a repeat, like on the second F) then you'll have one added to the "correct" score. If you either click incorrectly (i.e., when there is no repeat, like on anything else) OR fail to click when there IS a repeat, then you'll have one added to the "incorrect" score.<br><br>

Think you've got it? We have a little training sequence for you to try just to make sure. Press "Next" when you're ready to have a go.<br><br>
