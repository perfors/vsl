<em>What was that about, anyway?</em><br><br>

As before, this study was run by the “Adelaide Computational Cognitive Science” group are associated in some way with the CCS lab at the University of Adelaide. Here's the basic idea for this one... <br><br>

<em>What's the big picture?</em><br><br>

Just in case you didn't read the debrief last time, we'll cover some of the same ground at first. We’re a bunch of psychologists interested in fundamental questions about how people reason and learn in real life. One big issue is how people learn which things in the world "go together". In the real world, this kind of learning happens all of the time. For instance, people notice what objects tend to occur in the same environments and probably use this information to help classify them (e.g., babies learn that things are toys in part because they occur in the same places as things they know are toys). People notice what kinds of things various different social groups wear. People are even attuned to really subtle things like what kinds of plants are in different places, what colours are associated with different locations, and so forth. So we're interested in understanding how people do this sort of learning.<br><br>

In this study (and the previous one) we investigated this by asking you to look at, and probably learn about, sequences of artificial stimuli or letters. When you were with us last time, we still at the stage of finding a task that worked (by which we mean, people could do it, but it wasn't so simple that everyone was near to 100%). Reassuringly, the last study <em>did</em> work, which means we could move on to our next question -- and that's what you've been helping us with today.<br><br>

The main question we were investigating here is what other abilities underlie the skill of tracking and using these kinds of statistical regularities. Our hypothesis  is that it is releated to perceptual fluency -- that is, whether you can learn statistical relationships between things in the world depends mainly on how easily you managed to encode and remember those things in the first place. Some of you were in a condition where you saw sequences with similar shapes both last time and today. Others saw letters one day and complex shapes the other day. If perceptual fluency is really at the root of people's statistical learning abilities, then we would expect that people's performance from one day to the next will be far more consistent if they have the same kinds of stimuli on both of those days. That's the hypothesis we're testing, so your data from <em>both</em> days is important to test this.<br><br>

As we often try to do in science, we've built in another test of the hypothesis as  well. Those last two short tasks with the flashing objects was a kind of base measure of perceptual fluency. The idea of this kind of measure is that if you have an easier time tracking and remembering something, you'll be more accurate even when it flashes up really quickly. Our hypothesis is that your ability to figure out the statistical regularities in one of the sequences you saw will be well predicted by your performance on these measures of perceptual fluency, and it <em>won't</em> be well-predicted by your ability to find the statistical regularities in the otehr sequences.<br><br>

Is that what happened? That's the fun of science - we don't know yet; nobody knows yet. We'll know when we analyse the data. In the meantime, you have our gratitude for taking this seriously, not once but twice, and thus contributing a little piece to what we know about how people think.<br><br>
