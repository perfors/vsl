The following task is very similar to the one you did for us (the University of Adelaide) a few days ago. As a reminder, we are interested in how people learn about visual sequences. As before, you will see a long sequence of different kinds of visual patterns one by one. For some of you they will be very similar to the ones you saw before, and for others they will be pretty different. Everything else is the same: the sequence plays automatically and takes about 10 minutes total. Your main job is just to watch it: don't try to write anything down, just watch. Because watching is pretty boring, though, and because we want to make sure you're paying attention, you have the same additional task as last time. As a reminder, here is how it goes:<br><br>

Every so often instead of a pattern or letter, you'll see an entire English word. When you do, just write it down. For instance, if you saw the sequence A - B - F - pizza - F - D, you should write down <em>pizza</em>. At the end of the sequence you'll be given a text box in which you should input all of the words you saw (in this case, <em>pizza</em>). Over the course of the entire sequence there will be between 2 and 10 English words (not the same ones as last time). Try to get them all! And when you're not writing anything down, just watch and do your best to notice if you detect any regularities between which items follow each other. After viewing the sequence for about 10 minutes, we'll ask you some questions about the kinds of patterns you learned.<br><br> 

The main difference between this experiment and last time is that after answering those questions, you'll be asked to additionally do two relatively short tasks. In each one you'll see one item flash on screen fairly quickly, and then it will go away and you'll have to select which of four possible items it was. If you get the question right, the next item will be faster. Each task involves multiple items but is reasonably fast (depending on how fast you are!), taking about 3-5 minutes each.<br><br>

As before, this experiment will require some concentration and you will need to be paying attention the whole time. We'll explain what it was all about at the end! Press "Next" when you're ready to have a go. Clicking "Next" also indicates your consent to take part in this study.<br><br>
