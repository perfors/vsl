This contains files and data for the visual statistical learning project

*expts1and2* contains the data and code for Experiments 1 and 2 in the original paper (along with the original paper draft). 

*expt3* contains the data and code for Experiment 3 in the follow-up, in which we tried to disconfound familiarity from simplicity by presenting the same stimuli to either Chinese or English speakers

within each folder, the data and analysis scripts are in the *data* folder, the javascript code for running the experiment is in the *experimentcode* folder, and the stimuli are in a separate *stimuli* folder (they can also be found in the experiment code folder)
